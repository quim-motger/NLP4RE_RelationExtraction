# NLP4RE Book - Chapter 8 - Relation Extraction

Notebook and datasets for NLP4RE Book - Chapter 8 - Relation Extraction. This chapter presents a comprehensive overview of natural language-based relation extraction from text-based requirements. We structure these techniques into two different sub-sections: 

1. **NLP Knowledge Representation Techniques** for the identification and categorization of requirements relations (i.e., syntactic vs. semantic techniques)
2. **Information Extraction Methods** for the task of relation extraction (i.e., retrieval-based vs. machine learning-based methods).
